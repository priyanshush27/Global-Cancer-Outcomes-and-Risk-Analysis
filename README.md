# Global-Cancer-Outcomes-and-Risk-Analysis
"EDA on 50K cancer patient records using Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib). Applied regression, correlations &amp; Random Forest to assess risk factors, severity, diagnosis trends, and treatment costs, uncovering global disparities in healthcare outcomes via statistical analysis &amp; visualization."

# Global Cancer Outcomes & Risk Analysis

## 📌 Project Vision
This project harnesses the power of advanced analytics and global health data to uncover actionable insights into cancer care, patient outcomes, and disparities.  
Using a robust dataset of **50,000 cancer patient records** collected from multiple countries between **2015 and 2024**, the goal is to bridge the gap between raw data and life-saving decisions.

---

## 📊 Dataset Coverage
The dataset provides a **360-degree view of cancer patient profiles**, including:
- **Demographics**: Age, gender, country, year of diagnosis  
- **Genetic & Lifestyle Risks**: Genetic predisposition, smoking, alcohol use, obesity  
- **Environmental Exposure**: Air pollution levels  
- **Clinical & Economic Variables**: Cancer type, stage, treatment cost  
- **Patient Outcomes**: Survival years, severity scores

## 🎯 Core Objectives

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Identified key trends, hidden patterns, and relationships  
- Visualized disparities in diagnosis, lifestyle, treatment, and outcomes  
- Highlighted variations across countries, age groups, and cancer stages  

### 2. Inferential & Predictive Analytics
- Determined the relationship between **risk factors and cancer severity** using regression and line plots  
- Analyzed the proportion of **early-stage diagnoses by cancer type**  
- Identified **key predictors of cancer severity and survival years** using Pearson & Spearman correlations  
- Validated severity score predictions with **Random Forest modeling**  
- Explored the **economic burden of cancer treatment** across demographics and countries  
- Assessed whether **higher treatment cost is associated with longer survival**  
- Evaluated if **higher cancer stages lead to greater treatment costs and reduced survival years**  
- Examined how **high genetic risk amplifies the negative effects of smoking** on severity and survival outcomes  

### 3. Insight Extraction & Documentation
- Generated **evidence-backed insights** for clinical, academic, and operational use  
- Linked findings to **real-world implications** to guide decision-making and policy formulation  
- Documented all analyses systematically for reproducibility and transparency  

---

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools Demonstrated
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels  
- **Statistics**: Descriptive analysis, regression, correlation (Pearson, Spearman), hypothesis testing  
- **Machine Learning**: Random Forest for severity score prediction
- **Visualization**: KDE plots, histograms, line plots, comparative charts
